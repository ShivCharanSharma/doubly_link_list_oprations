# doubly_link_list_oprations

This project was implemented as college assignment.

It contain libraries, implemented in C language, for performing different types of operation on linked lists.

Description to use this project is as follows:

## Makefile

### Compile using Makefile

To compile all programs, run following command in root directory of submission
where Makefile file is present

	make build
	
After running make build command, executable files and related to source (.c)
file can be located in their respective directories. The directories are discussed 
in the directory structure as follows:

## Directory Structure

### For solution1
For solution of 1st question directory is:
	
	 solution1/
	
It contains two folders:
 1. 1a
 2. 1b
 
Folder **1a** contains the code for linked list functions and their testing with the user commands.
It contains 2 files a4q1a_int.c and a4q1a_char.c which contains the integer and character linked list
respectively, and two command files cmd1.txt and cmd2.txt for testing purpose.
      
Folder **1b** contains the code for linked list and function pointers with the user commands. It contains 
a4q1b.c, sorted_list.c, sorted_list.h and cmd.txt for testing purpose.

### For solution2
For solution of 2nd question directory is:

	solution2/
	
It contain two folders:
 1. 2a
 2. 2b
 
Folder **2a** contain sorce code for question 2 Recusive functions and their test and commands.
It contain four files, a4q2.c ,sorted_list.c ,sorted_list.h and cmd.txt. **a4q2.c** contain function such as count_down ,count_up, nth,nth_sorted ,remove_nth,remove_nth_sorted etc. and program to test commands.
**sorted_list.c** contain sorted list and its related functions , **sorted_list.h** is it's corresponding header files.


Folder **2b** contain sorce code for question 2 Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
It contain **a4q2b.c** it contain function for Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), implemented using tail recurion.

### Explaination why it is tail recursive.
The tail recursive implementation means that the recursive call statement must be the last
statement of the function. The gcd function made in 2b program is also tail recursive. The
reason is that the recursive statement **return gcd(b, a%b);** is the last statement execute
by the function and after that the function is called again for the different values of a an
b as calculated in the function. Thus, the implementation of gcd is tail recursive.

### For solution3
For solution of 3rd question directory is :

	solution3/
	
It contain source code for question 3 ADT Fraction and its related functions and filter functions.

In solution3
	
 • a4q3.c contain source code for commands and test for question 3 functions and ADT Fraction.
 
 • a.c contain function definition of question 3 functions related to Fractions.And a.h is It’s 
 corresponding header file.
 
 • functions.c contain filter function with its recusive definition. It also contain map/reduce/etc  
 functions . And function.h is it’s corresponding header file.
 
 • sorted_list.c contain function related to Sorted List data type and its definition. sorted_list.h 
 is it’s corresponding header files.
